# ibm-quantum-challenge-2024
I participated in the IBM quantum challenge lab series this year! It was a great experience to get to learn the new Qiskit 1.0 library and see the developments happening at IBM for QC. Despite having finished the lab series, I did not save labs 1 or 3 in the cloud environment so they are missing from this repo :(
